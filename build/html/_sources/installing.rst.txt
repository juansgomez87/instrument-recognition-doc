Installation
============
This implementation uses the *librosa* python package in order to extract the melspectrograms
that are used to train the neural network. *Pandas* is used to organize the results in 
dataframes and evaluate them. *Keras* is the neural networks API used for the implementation
of all the models. Finally, *matplotlib* is used to plot the final results of the performance
metrics obtained. Additionally, the implementation was created in Python 3.
